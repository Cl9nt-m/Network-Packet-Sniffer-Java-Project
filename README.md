# Network Packet Sniffer is a piece of software that monitors all network traffic

# SCOPE OF THE PROJECT

The objective of the system is to create a new set of rules during run time. So the intruder cannot be able to attack the system with virus. 
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) has become one of the hottest research areas in Computer Security.
Intrusion Detection System is a system for detecting intrusions and reporting them accurately to the proper authority. Intrusion Detection Systems are usually specific to the operating system that they operate in and are an important tool in the overall implementation of an organizations information security policy.
A methodology of applying genetic algorithm into network intrusion detection technique is unique as it considers both temporal and spatial information of network connections during the encoding of the problem; therefore, it should be more helpful for identification of network anomalous behaviors.

# About the Project

A Network Packet Sniffer is a piece of software that monitors all network traffic. Unlike standard network hosts that only receive traffic sent specifically to them. As data streams flow across the network, the sniffer captures each packet and eventually decodes and analyzes its content. 

    For network monitoring purposes it may also be desirable to monitor all data packets in a LAN and to mirror all packets passing through a shared bus.

This project will be comprised of three modules namely : 

       The User Interface module
User Interface module provides all the Graphical Interface components necessary for the user to interact with the System.
The Analysis Module will analyze the incoming packets into a computer, identify them and passes the information into the Statistics module.

    The statistics module
This does the necessary calculation based on the information and produce information that can be understood by the user.
This system is thus very useful to the users and a network administrator responsible for monitoring things on a network.
This system is a network analyzer (also known as protocol analyzer & packet sniffer) ;

     It performs real-time packet capturing, 
     24x7 network monitoring, advanced protocol analyzing, 
     In-depth packet decoding,
     Automatic expert diagnosing. 
     A clear view of the complex network, 
     Conduct packet level analysis,
     Troubleshoot network problems.
     
This provides an administrator with a full set of reports such as Summary view, Endpoints view, and Protocols view.
NETWORK PACKET SNIFFER is a desktop application which facilitates online monitoring of packets which are traveling over the network.
NETWORK PACKET SNIFFER I is a tool in which the packets source and destination addresses and other information is captured.
The source and destination address protocols that are used by a connection are also monitored and detected.
The graph or charts displayed on the valuation and need.
The monitored packets source and destination address is captured. This shows the traffic on a network.

# THE SYSTEM

We can get a quick view of the total traffic, real-time traffic, broadcast traffic, multicast traffic and so on. When we switch among the node from the explorer, corresponding traffic information will be provided.
The Endpoints view; we can monitor network traffic information of each node, both local and remote. With its easy sorting feature we can easily find out which host is generating or has generated the largest traffic.
The Protocols view will list all protocols applied in network transmission.
In Protocols view we can monitor network traffic by each protocol. By analyzing network traffic by protocol, we can understand what applications are using the network bandwidth, for example "http" protocol stands for website browsing, "pop3" stands for email, etc.

# Advantages with the proposed system:

Network Admin can monitor the packets any where through out the world.
Traffic can be controlled.
System performance will be increased.
Immediate generation of reports on demand.
Graphical data is available to analyze the network.
